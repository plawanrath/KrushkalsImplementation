Plawan Kumar Rath

SInce we already knoe the file name, I have set it inside the code. To run the code you simply need to run the java file, no command line arguments are needed.

I have used the DisjSets class given in the book and the Krushkals algorithm given in the book. I have used PriorityQueue class provided in java.
I have written a custom Comparator to compare the objects of Edge class based on edge weights (distances).


How to Compile and run:

javac *.java
java Krushkals

A sample output after running the code is given below:

Plawans-MacBook-Pro:src plawanrath$ javac *.java

Plawans-MacBook-Pro:src plawanrath$ java Krushkals
